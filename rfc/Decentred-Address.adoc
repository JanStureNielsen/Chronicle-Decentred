= Decentred Address
Peter Lawrey

Chronicle Decentred uses a 64-bit unsigned `long` for addresses of accounts and destinations. Addresses have a range for different purposes

=== Ranges

An address with a public key requires the address to be the last 8 bytes of the public key (in little endian)

|===
| Top 16 bits | Purpose | Public key? | format
| 0x0000 | Temporary connections | no | @IP Address:port
| 0x0001 - 0x00FF | reserved | na
| 0x0100 - 0xDFFF | verified IP address | yes | @IP Address:port:lower bits
| 0xE000 - 0xFFFF | user accounts | yes | @address in base 32
|===

=== Verified IP address

The format of an address which can be verified consists of

- The IPv4 address of the server (top 32-bits)
- The port of the server (next 16-bits)
- Any number which matches the public key (lower 16-bits)

=== User accounts

User accounts have to have the top 3 bits set to distinguish them
from verified server addresses.

=== Printing addresses.

Addresses come in three formats

|===
| format | example
| IP Address:port | 172.10.11.12:12345
| IP Address:port:lower bit | 172.10.11.12:12345:65432
| base32 address | abcdefghijkl
