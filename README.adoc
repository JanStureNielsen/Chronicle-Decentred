Chronicle Decentred is a framework for building Secure Scalable Microservices on Distributed Ledger Technology.

The purpose of this library is to make it easy to create a high throughput microservice which can be run in a decentralised manner.

=== What features will be supported in the open source version

The open source version will

- 10K - 100K transactions per second per sub-chain depending on hardware.
- latencies down to the tens of milli-seconds (depending on network connectivity)
- testing tools for creating new transaction types
- supports digital and fiat currencies including XCL (Accelerate token)
- simple decentralised consensus strategy (PoIP - Proof Of IP)
- simple exchange of value

=== What features will the Enterprise version have

The Enterprise version is designed to add features a commercial operator would like

- supports bursts of millions of messages per second.
- tighter latencies (sub-milli-second for Proof of Receipt)
- more options for exchange of value including continuous auctions.
- more pluggable consensus strategies
- doesn't require a digital currency to run.

=== How does it work?

.Workflow for transactions on the blockchain

- A client connects to a server over TCP.
- The gateway receives the transaction and verifies its signature
- The gateway can process the request or query and send a reply, or it can pass the request onto the blockchain.
- Transactions passed to the blockchain are batched into blocks. Each node creates a block concurrently (as needed)
- Blocks are replicated across nodes via TCP.
- Each node gossips about the blocks it has.
- Each node votes on which blocks to include in the next round.
- Once a majority of node vote the same way, those blocks are included in the next round.
- Transaction in the next round are processed in order.
- The results of those transactions are published on all nodes.
- Events to pass back to the client are returned over TCP.

=== Getting started

Under `examples/appreciation` there is a module containing tests for transaction.

A more complex example is `examples/exchange` for transfer and exchange of value.
